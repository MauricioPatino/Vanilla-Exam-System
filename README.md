# Vanilla-Exam-System
Senior college project was to built an exam system for instructors to create and grade exams with a built in autograder written in Python. Students would take online exams written
by their professors and must answer in Python. Professors make their online exams using the system we built. The exams are auto-graded after students hit submit on their exam.
